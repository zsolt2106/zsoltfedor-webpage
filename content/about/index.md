<h2> I'm Zsolt</h2>

 * University student at University of Debrecen  
  Computer Science Engineering BsC   
  Since 2020  
  Graduating in 2024  
<br>
* Picked up Linux in 2023  
I use [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) (btw) mainly because I really like the "build-it-yourself" idea behind it. It's my favourite Linux distribution so far. It's minimal and gives you a pretty good understanding how a Linux system works. Also gets pretty easy to use after you get over the learning curve.  
I still use Windows in my free time, but professionally i find myself using Linux more and more.
