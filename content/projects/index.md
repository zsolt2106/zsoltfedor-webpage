  I was eyeing with Hugo for a while now so thought I'll give it a try. Picked this theme because it looked the most simple one (kinda enjoying simple designs). If you wanna learn more about Hugo just click [here](https://gohugo.io/). It's free and easy to use. Also this theme in particular is **completely JavaScript Free !**
